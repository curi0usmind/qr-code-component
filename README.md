## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Figma pixel-perfect (at least I gave it a shot)

### What I learned

I wanted to give every element a seperate class, but figured it'd be overkill for such a small site.

Since the image is used purely for styling, I've decided not to use figure and figcaption.

### Continued development

- Looking forward to using advanced CSS selectors
- Can't wait to get my hands on some JS again

### Useful resources

- [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - This helped me improve my Markdown skills for writing in this file.
